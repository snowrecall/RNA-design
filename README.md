The directory T1-RNA-kinetic-simulation-scripts contain the kinetic simulation scripts for T1 RNA.

The directories T1-short, T1, T1-delAU, T1-add2bp, T2, T3, and T4 contain the filtering and the analytical scripts to obtain our desired RNA candidates (The Linux executable version of MC-Fold can be downloaded from https://www.major.iric.ca/MC-Fold/). The directory MCFOLD-DB is required when executing mcfold.static.exe.

Here are the candidate sequences we have selected for each RNA:
