####generate sequences for MC-Fold####

python step1_generate_all_seq_filter_pairs.py > step1.out (##The variable 3x3 internal loop is composed of three mismatched that can be anyone from AA, AC, CA, UC, CU and CC, leading to a total of 216 combinations.)

####operate MC-Fold Results####

mkdir run_mcfold

cp step1.out run_mcfold

./step2_run_mcfold.sh

./step3_get_operate_file.sh (##The best 100-suboptimal MC-Fold solutions for each candidate RNA.##)

./step_new_41_get_our_structures_and_deltaG.sh

./step_new_42_to_run.sh > step_new_42_to_run.out (##The free energy difference between ground state and predefined excited state.##)

python step_new_43_sort.py (##The qualified RNA sequences were sorted in ascending order of the free energy differences.##)(##The final output file is step_new_43_sort.out.##)
